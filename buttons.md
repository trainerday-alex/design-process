### Button Usage


- Use the strong button (with red background) when their is only 1 important button we care about on the page "sign up," or  one primary action at the bottom of a popup.  
- Other wise use the normal primary button with red borders
- Finally for any less important action or not clearly the most important use a secondary action.  If someone does the action and the button changes state change it to secondary.
